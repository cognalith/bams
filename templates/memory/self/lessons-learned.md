# Lessons Learned

> Wisdom earned through experience. Patterns that have been **tested** and proven.
> This file is semantic memory — 90+ day half-life. Lessons persist because they were earned.

## Format

Each lesson should include:
- **What happened** — The situation or event
- **What was learned** — The insight or pattern
- **When** — Valid Time (when it was true) and Transaction Time (when recorded)
- **Tested or Absorbed** — Was this applied and verified, or just observed?

## Lessons

*[Lessons graduate here from daily experience files during heartbeat reviews. Only record what has been tested through application.]*
